    <h2>Description</h2> <p>The BioID Face Database has been recorded
    and is published to give all researchers working in the area of
    face detection the possibility to compare the quality of their
    face detection algorithms with others. During the recording
    special emphasis has been laid on "real world"
    conditions. Therefore the testset features a large variety of
    illumination, background and face size. For sample images please
    vistit the <a
    href="http://www.humanscan.de/support/downloads/facedb.php">BioID
    Face DB</a> page.</p> <p>The dataset consists of 1521 gray level
    images with a resolution of 384x286 pixel. Each one shows the
    frontal view of a face of one out of 23 different test
    persons. For comparison reasons the set also contains manually set
    eye postions. The images are labeled "BioID_xxxx.pgm" where the
    characters xxxx are replaced by the index of the current image
    (with leading zeros). Similar to this, the files "BioID_xxxx.eye"
    contain the eye positions for the corresponding images.</p>
    <h2>Image File Format</h2> <p>The images are stored in single
    files using the portable gray map (pgm) data format. A pgm file
    contains a data header followed by the image data. In our case the
    header consists of four lines of text.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first line describes the format of the image data
 (ASCII/binary). In our files the text "P5" indicates that the data
 is written in binary form</li>
      <li>The second line contains the image width written in text form</li>
      <li>The third line keeps the image height also in text form</li>
      <li>The fourth line contains the maximum allowed gray value (255 in our images</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The header is followed by a data block containing the image data. The
data is stored line per line from top to bottom using one byte per
pixel.</p>
    <h2>Eye Position File Format</h2>
    <p>The eye position files are text files containing a single comment line
followed by the x and the y coordinate of the left eye and the x and
the y coordinate of the right eye separated by spaces. Note that we
refer to the left eye as the person's left eye. Therefore, when
captured by a camera, the position of the left eye is on the image's
right and vice versa.</p>
    <h2>FGnet Markup Scheme of the BioID Face Database</h2>
    <p>The BioID Face Database is being used within the FGnet project
    of the European Working Group on face and gesture
    recognition. David Cristinacce and Kola Babalola, PhD students
    from the department of Imaging Science and Biomedical Engineering
    at the University of Manchester marked up the images from the
    BioID Face Database. They selected several additional feature
    points, which are very useful for facial analysis and gesture
    recognition.
