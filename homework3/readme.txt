./Source contains the source code files for this project, written in Python with ‚ù§
    There're four configuration files here. You can change the configuration according to that
    There's documentation for the configuration in the loadConfig method of `eigenface.py`
    The files you should use to run stuff are `test.py` and `train.py`
    You can train a model using: 
        `python train.py -p <dataset_path> -i <image_ext, like .jpg> -t <text_ext, like .txt> -c <configuration_file> -m <output_model>`
        Refer to `python train.py -h` for more information
    You can test with a model using: 
        `python test.py -i <test_image> -m <trained_model> -c <configuration_file> -o <output_image>`
        Refer to `python test.py -h` for more information
    And there's also two haar_cascade eye recognizor file. Make sure the program can find them.

./Dataset contains two datasets of our own "MyDataSet" and "MySmallDataSet", roughly 445 images in "MyDataSet" andd 45 images in "MySmallDataSet". All annotated with a text file.

./Test contains some test image. I'm xz and there's two images of me for test. "image_xz_0002.jpg" is NOT in the dataset for training. And "image_xz_0006.jpg" is in the dataset for training.

./Results contains some test results

./Report contains the source and the pdf version of the project report.
